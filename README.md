# Teamsight
Teamsight is an app designed for youth sport coaches and athletes (particularly swimming in this first iteration). The app allows coaches to establish a better connection with their athletes by using daily check-ins, a feed where coaches can post articles and messages, and allowing athletes to keep track of their goals. This app was built using React, Redux, Express, and Sequelize.
